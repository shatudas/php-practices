   Remind yourself of what you did - Most programmers have experienced coming back to their own work a year or two later and having to re-figure out what they did. Comments can remind you of what you were thinking when you wrote the code. PHP supports several ways of commenting:</span><br>

  <h2>Syntax for single-line comments:</h2><br>

   <span>// This is a single-line comment<br>
			# This is also a single-line comment</span>
  <?php
			// This is a single-line comment
			# This is also a single-line comment
			?>


			<h2>Syntax for multiple-line comments:</h2><br>
  
   <span>/* This is a single-line comment<br>
			 This is also a single-line comment */</span>
  <?php
			/* This is a single-line comment<br>
			 This is also a single-line comment */
			?>
